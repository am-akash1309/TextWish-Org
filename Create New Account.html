              <p><h6>Things that you and others do and provide.</h6></p>
              <p>Information and content you provide. We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content that you provide (e.g. metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through features that we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things such as suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications that you and others provide to analyse context and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.</p>

              <h6 class="makebold">What are cookies?</h6>
              <p>Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device, which uniquely identifies your browser or device. We may use technologies such as cookies, pixels and local storage to deliver, secure and understand products, services and ads.</p>
              <h6 class="makebold">What are cookies used for?</h6>
              <p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or services to know if your computer or device has visited it before. These technologies can then be used to deliver products, services and ads, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help us remember your preferences and generally improve your experience of using our services. Cookies can also help ensure that marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
              <h6 class="makebold">Why does TextWish use cookies and similar technologies?</h6>
              <p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience and help protect TextWish and our users. We may use these technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to move around the service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, and store information so that TextWish responds faster. We may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the service, for example which pages you go to most often and whether you get error messages from certain pages. We may use these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you. These cookies can also be used to remember changes that you've made to the text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. TextWish or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests. These technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than TextWish. This information may be shared with organisations outside TextWish, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. *We may use these technologies to understand, improve and research products and services.</p>
